In the upcoming summer semester, I am giving again a [lecture about Quantum Computing](https://webapps.unitn.it/du/en/Persona/PER0215513/Didattica).

In this lecture, I will discuss fundamentals of quantum computers, concepts from quantum-information theory, and various experimental platforms. Through theoretical lectures and practical exercises, we will understand functioning, possibilities, and limitations of state-of-the-art quantum computers.
